Create a function that takes an integer as the argument. This integer specifies the number of sides the dice has. Your function should output a number that you could get by rolling the specified type of dice. Once you think your function works modify it so it creates an array of dice rolled values. The length of the array should be specified by an additional argument for your function. Take the average of these values to check if your function works as expected for an array of $1000$ values. In general the average for rolling a certain dice should be half the maximum value plus $0.5$, so $5.5$ for a d10 for example. You should get close to this value but will likely be off slightly. "
